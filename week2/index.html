   	<h1>Week 2: Reaction to Reading</h1>
	 <p class="week-2">"Handmade Web" by J. R. Carpenter</br></br>I found the reading, “Handmade Web” for this week to be pretty interesting. The term "handmade" in reference to web pages was a new idea for me becuase I had a different idea of what handmade meant. Before the reading, I wouldn't have necessarily chosen "handmade" to describe something so digital, like the web. However, when web pages are compared to print materials, mentioned in the reading, "handmade" seems right to describe the two. </p>
